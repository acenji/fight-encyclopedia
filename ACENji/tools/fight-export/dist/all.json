        "Description": "A head-and-arm choke applied from the guard position, where the attacker traps the opponent’s arm and head between their own arm and torso. The attacker pivots their hips and angles to the side to compress the opponent’s carotid arteries using the shoulder and opponent’s own arm.

        "Description": "A no-gi variation of the arm triangle choke applied from half guard. The attacker threads their arm under the opponent’s head and traps the far arm, then uses shoulder pressure, chest connection, and hip angling to tighten the choke. The bottom half guard leg is used both to control distance and to maintain leverage until the choke is locked or the guard is transitioned.",

Keep knee pressure to pin hips, **drop right shoulder** toward the neck, **walk your body toward the head at ~45°**, and sprawl the left leg for base.

        "Aliases": "Reverse Arm Triangle from KOB | Reverse-Angle Kata Gatame | Knee Ride Reverse Head-and-Arm",
        "Description": "A kata gatame (head-and-arm choke) applied from knee-on-belly using a **reverse finishing angle**. Instead of walking your chest toward the opponent’s head (standard finish), you rotate so your head and chest face more toward the opponent’s **hips**, tightening the head-and-arm seal with shoulder drop and elbow adduction. This is an arm-triangle throughout—no leg triangle involved.",
        "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Lateral vascular compression using opponent’s trapped arm across their neck + attacker’s shoulder/chest pressure || Joints Affected | Neck (carotids), shoulder of trapped arm || Torque/Force | Shoulder adduction, scapular protraction, chest drop; reverse body angle closes remaining space around the neck",
        "Position / Entry Examples": "From side control, step to **knee-on-belly**. Use a **cross-face with your right arm** to turn the head away; with your left hand (C-grip on wrist/triceps) **feed the near arm across** the opponent’s neck. Slide your **right arm under the head** and around the trapped arm; connect **gable** or **figure-four (RNC-style: right hand grabs right biceps; left hand to crown)**. To finish **reverse angle**: keep knee pressure, **rotate your torso so your chest faces their hips**, drop your **right shoulder** deep into the neck, **sprawl the free (left) leg** for base, and **walk slightly toward their hips** until the space closes. Squeeze elbows together, keep your head low, and maintain hip-to-hip connection as needed. Option: slide to mount while keeping the lock if you need more pressure.",
        "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
        "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Direct vascular choke from dominant top control; once sealed, loss of consciousness can occur quickly.",

        "History / Origin": "Modern BJJ adaptation of kata gatame emphasizing alternate finishing angles from knee-on-belly; commonly taught as a way to finish when the standard head-side walk meets stubborn frames.",
        "Common Mistakes": "Leaning too far forward (risking sweep) || Trying to finish without the arm truly across the neck || Keeping head too high (leaves space) || Squeezing without rotating to reverse angle—becomes neck crank instead of clean choke.",
        "Effectiveness": "Effective as both a finish and a control threat. Reverse angle often **seals lingering space** that resists the standard finish; while entry rate is similar, finishing percentage improves when the shoulder drop and hip-facing rotation are applied correctly. If defenses persist, it reliably opens transitions to mount or back.",

        "Description": "A side-control kata gatame finished with a full or partial sprawl.

The sprawl removes the defender’s bridge power and tightens carotid compression with minimal arm effort.",
        "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Shoulder/chest compression with defender’s arm as wedge || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries); shoulder (secondary) || Forces | Downward shoulder pressure, lateral chest squeeze, hip sprawl to anchor weight",
