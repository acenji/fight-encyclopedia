    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (From Guard – Crossface Grip)",
    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Arm-and-Head Lock (From Guard – Crossface Grip)",
    "Aliases": "Crossface Arm Triangle from Guard | Crossface Guard Kata Gatame | Crossface Head-and-Arm Choke from Guard",
    "Description": "A crossface-based variation of the arm triangle choke applied from the guard position. Instead of using a collar grip, the attacker drives a crossface under the opponent’s head, trapping the far arm and head together. The shoulder pressure and hip angle close off the carotid arteries, with the crossface creating strong control and posture break.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Lateral compression of neck and arm with crossface shoulder pressure || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries), shoulder, upper arm || Torque Direction | Side pressure from hip pivot combined with crossface control and shoulder drive",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From closed guard | Shoot crossface arm deep under opponent’s head to far armpit, trap arm, angle hips to the side, and lock the head-and-arm choke.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Submission Grappling | Judo (less common due to gi grip preference)",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Same as standard arm triangle; can render unconscious quickly if held.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal (crossface control is common) | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Emphasize deep crossface and shoulder pressure; combine with hip pivot. Avoid leaving space under the armpit or failing to control opponent’s far shoulder.",
    "Training Notes": "Must be applied slowly and with control. Beginners often over-apply force. Use compliant partners when learning.",
    "History / Origin": "Adapted in no-gi and MMA contexts where the collar grip is unavailable, the crossface version became a natural guard option for maintaining head control.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Shallow crossface || Not trapping opponent’s arm tightly || Insufficient hip angle || Relying only on arm squeeze instead of shoulder drive.",
    "Effectiveness": "No-gi arm triangle || Darce choke || Anaconda choke || Triangle choke || Armbar from guard",
    "Related Techniques": "Wrist Lock Extension | Armbar variations | Elbow Lock",
    "Tags": "crossface arm triangle from guard | no-gi kata gatame from guard | head-and-arm choke crossface | BJJ | MMA | submission | guard submission",
    "Notes": "Often chained after failed guillotine or when opponent hides their neck during collar choke defense.",
