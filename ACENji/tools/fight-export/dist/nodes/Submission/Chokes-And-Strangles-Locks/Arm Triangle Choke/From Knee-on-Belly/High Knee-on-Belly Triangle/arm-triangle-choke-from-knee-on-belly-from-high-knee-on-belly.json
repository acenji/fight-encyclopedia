    "Entity Name": "Arm Triangle Choke (From High Knee-on-Belly)",
    "English Name": "Head-and-Arm Choke (From High Knee-on-Belly)",
    "Japanese Name": "肩固め（高膝乗せから）",
    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (From High Knee-on-Belly)",
    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Head-and-Arm Choke (From High Knee-on-Belly)",
    "Aliases": "High Knee Ride Arm Triangle | High KOB Kata Gatame | Shoulder Pin Choke from Knee-on-Belly",
    "Description": "A kata gatame (head-and-arm choke) variation performed from a high knee-on-belly position, where the attacker slides the knee further up toward the opponent’s chest or shoulder line. This elevated base increases shoulder and chest pressure into the opponent’s neck, creating a tight arm-triangle configuration while maintaining positional dominance.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Vascular compression using the opponent’s trapped arm across their neck combined with chest/shoulder pressure || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries), shoulder of trapped arm || Torque/Force | Inward adduction and scapular protraction with chest drop, reinforced by the higher knee ride for leverage",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From side control, step into **high knee-on-belly** with knee sliding near the opponent’s upper chest/shoulder. Use cross-face (right arm across jawline) to turn head away, and with left arm control/trap the near arm across the neck. Slide your choking arm (right) under the head and around the trapped arm, connect gable grip or figure-four. With knee pressure pinning the torso, drop shoulder pressure, angle body toward opponent’s head, and sprawl free leg to finish the choke. Optionally settle into mount while maintaining choke pressure.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Stronger neck compression than standard KOB due to higher leverage and restricted chest expansion; unconsciousness may occur rapidly.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Standard knee-on-belly arm triangle || High knee ride to mounted kata gatame transition || Wrist control feed across to high KOB || High knee ride to reverse kata gatame",
    "Training Notes": "Keep weight centered—don’t lean too far forward (risking sweep) || Maintain knee pressure high on chest to limit breathing and shoulder movement || Use head positioning to close gaps || If choke stalls, slide into mounted arm triangle for stronger finish.",
    "History / Origin": "Evolved from classical kata gatame; the “high knee ride” variation became common in modern BJJ as practitioners experimented with mobility and pressure attacks from knee-on-belly.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Not lifting knee high enough (loses chest control) || Overcommitting forward, giving opponent a bridge/sweep || Squeezing arms without dropping shoulder and angling properly (results in crank, not choke).",
    "Effectiveness": "Highly effective—high knee placement creates additional restriction on breathing and posture, combining suffocating pressure with direct vascular choke. Reliable as both a submission and as a transition threat to mount/back if escape is attempted.",
    "Related Techniques": "Side control kata gatame || Standard knee-on-belly arm triangle || Mount arm triangle || D’arce choke || Anaconda choke",
    "Tags": "high knee on belly arm triangle | kob kata gatame high ride | head-and-arm choke high knee ride | BJJ | Judo | MMA | top control submissions",
    "Notes": "The higher knee ride adds both positional pressure and psychological discomfort, often forcing opponents to expose defenses faster.",
