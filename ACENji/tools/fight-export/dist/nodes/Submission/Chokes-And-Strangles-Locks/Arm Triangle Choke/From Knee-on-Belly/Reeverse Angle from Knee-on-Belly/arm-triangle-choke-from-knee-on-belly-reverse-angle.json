    "Entity Name": "Arm Triangle Choke (From Knee-on-Belly – Reverse Angle)",
    "English Name": "Head-and-Arm Choke (From Knee-on-Belly – Reverse Arm Triangle)",
    "Japanese Name": "肩固め（膝乗せから）",
    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (Reverse Angle, From Knee-on-Belly)",
    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Head-and-Arm Choke (Reverse Angle from Knee-on-Belly)",
    "Aliases": "Reverse Arm Triangle from KOB | Reverse-Angle Kata Gatame | Knee Ride Reverse Head-and-Arm",
    "Description": "A kata gatame (head-and-arm choke) applied from knee-on-belly using a **reverse finishing angle**. Instead of walking your chest toward the opponent’s head (standard finish), you rotate so your head and chest face more toward the opponent’s **hips**, tightening the head-and-arm seal with shoulder drop and elbow adduction. This is an arm-triangle throughout—no leg triangle involved.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Lateral vascular compression using opponent’s trapped arm across their neck + attacker’s shoulder/chest pressure || Joints Affected | Neck (carotids), shoulder of trapped arm || Torque/Force | Shoulder adduction, scapular protraction, chest drop; reverse body angle closes remaining space around the neck",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From side control, step to **knee-on-belly**. Use a **cross-face with your right arm** to turn the head away; with your left hand (C-grip on wrist/triceps) **feed the near arm across** the opponent’s neck. Slide your **right arm under the head** and around the trapped arm; connect **gable** or **figure-four (RNC-style: right hand grabs right biceps; left hand to crown)**. To finish **reverse angle**: keep knee pressure, **rotate your torso so your chest faces their hips**, drop your **right shoulder** deep into the neck, **sprawl the free (left) leg** for base, and **walk slightly toward their hips** until the space closes. Squeeze elbows together, keep your head low, and maintain hip-to-hip connection as needed. Option: slide to mount while keeping the lock if you need more pressure.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Direct vascular choke from dominant top control; once sealed, loss of consciousness can occur quickly.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Standard (head-side) KOB arm triangle finish || Reverse-angle finish to mounted kata gatame || Reverse-angle finish with wrist-control feed || Reverse-angle to d’arce/anaconda switch if arm slips\nTraining Notes\tMaintain **knee ride pressure** to pin hips || Keep the opponent’s **elbow high and across**; if it drops under the chin, re-feed || The finish comes from **angle + shoulder drop**, not just arm squeeze || If space remains, rotate a touch more toward hips or transition to mount for tighter compression.",
    "Training Notes": "Maintain **knee ride pressure** to pin hips || Keep the opponent’s **elbow high and across**; if it drops under the chin, re-feed || The finish comes from **angle + shoulder drop**, not just arm squeeze || If space remains, rotate a touch more toward hips or transition to mount for tighter compression.",
    "History / Origin": "Modern BJJ adaptation of kata gatame emphasizing alternate finishing angles from knee-on-belly; commonly taught as a way to finish when the standard head-side walk meets stubborn frames.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Leaning too far forward (risking sweep) || Trying to finish without the arm truly across the neck || Keeping head too high (leaves space) || Squeezing without rotating to reverse angle—becomes neck crank instead of clean choke.",
    "Effectiveness": "Effective as both a finish and a control threat. Reverse angle often **seals lingering space** that resists the standard finish; while entry rate is similar, finishing percentage improves when the shoulder drop and hip-facing rotation are applied correctly. If defenses persist, it reliably opens transitions to mount or back.",

    "Notes": "“Reverse” in this entry refers to the finishing **body angle of kata gatame (arm triangle choke)**, where the attacker rotates chest/head toward the opponent’s hips instead of toward the head. This is not to be confused with the **reverse triangle (gyaku sankaku jime)**, which is a leg-based choke belonging to the sankaku family.",
