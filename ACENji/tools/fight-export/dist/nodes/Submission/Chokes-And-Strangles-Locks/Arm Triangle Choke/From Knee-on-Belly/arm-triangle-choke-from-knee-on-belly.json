    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Arm-and-Head Lock (From Knee on Belly)",
    "Aliases": "Knee-on-Belly Arm Triangle | KOB Kata Gatame | Knee Ride Head-and-Arm Choke",
    "Description": "An arm triangle choke variation applied from the knee-on-belly position. The attacker drives the knee across the opponent’s torso to control posture, while isolating one arm against the opponent’s head. The top shoulder and chest compress the opponent’s trapped arm into the neck, while body weight and hip angle drive the choke. This setup combines positional dominance with immediate submission pressure.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Lateral compression of the neck with opponent’s own arm and attacker’s shoulder pressure || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries), shoulder || Torque Direction | Side pressure from shoulder and chest, reinforced by knee-on-belly base",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From side control, step knee across opponent’s torso into knee-on-belly, use cross-face or underhook to trap opponent’s arm against the head, then drive shoulder pressure while angling body to lock the choke.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Strong positional pressure and direct vascular choke; unconsciousness occurs quickly if not released.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Arm isolation triangle from knee on belly || High knee-on-belly triangle || Knee-on-belly to triangle setup || Reverse triangle from knee on belly || Standard triangle from knee on belly",
    "Training Notes": "Keep a stable base to avoid sweeps; use knee pressure to pin hips; angle chest and shoulder into choke rather than relying only on arm squeeze.",
    "History / Origin": "An adaptation of the traditional kata gatame, integrated into modern BJJ and Judo as a submission threat from the mobile knee-on-belly control position.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Not trapping the arm tightly || Overcommitting weight forward (risking sweep) || Poor angle, resulting in crank instead of choke.",
    "Effectiveness": "Highly effective due to combination of positional dominance, mobility, and choke pressure.",
    "Related Techniques": "Side control arm triangle || Mount arm triangle || D’arce choke || Anaconda choke",
    "Tags": "knee on belly arm triangle | kob kata gatame | head-and-arm choke knee ride | BJJ | Judo | MMA | top control submission",
