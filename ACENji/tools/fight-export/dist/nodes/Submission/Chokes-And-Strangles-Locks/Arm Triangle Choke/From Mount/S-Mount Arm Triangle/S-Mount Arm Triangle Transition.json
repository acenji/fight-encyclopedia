    "Entity Name": "S-Mount Arm Triangle Transition",
    "English Name": "Arm Triangle (S-Mount Transition)",
    "Japanese Name": "肩固め（Sマウント）",
    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (S-Mount)",
    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Head-and-Arm Choke (S-Mount)",
    "Aliases": "S-Mount Kata Gatame | S-Mount Arm Triangle | High-Mount Head-and-Arm Choke",
    "Description": "An arm triangle variation applied from S-Mount. The attacker raises one knee high beside the opponent’s head and swings the other knee across their chest, creating the “S” shape. This tightens control over the head-and-arm while giving greater downward pressure. The attacker may finish directly from S-Mount or transition to side control while maintaining the choke for increased tightness.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Shoulder and trapped-arm compression of the carotids with chest/hip weight angled from S-Mount || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries), shoulder (secondary) || Torque Direction | Downward diagonal pressure from chest and shoulder with lateral squeeze",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From mount, drive one knee high under opponent’s armpit, slide other knee across torso into S-Mount. Thread opponent’s arm across their neck, drop head and shoulder to the mat, and lock head-and-arm grip. Finish by squeezing from S-Mount or slide off to side control to increase angle.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "9/10 | Direct vascular choke with strong positional control; difficult for defender to bridge or escape due to high mount.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Direct S-Mount finish || S-Mount to Side Arm Triangle || S-Mount to Back Take if opponent rolls",
    "Training Notes": "Keep weight centered; do not lean too far forward or you risk losing balance. Control opponent’s far arm to prevent bridging. Drive chest down and squeeze with gradual shoulder pressure rather than arm strength.",
    "History / Origin": "Adapted from classical Kata Gatame; refined in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as an advanced mount submission. The S-Mount adjustment was popularized for creating maximum chest pressure while limiting opponent’s defensive options.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Not securing high knee position before setting the choke || Letting the opponent’s elbow escape from across the neck || Overcommitting chest forward and getting swept || Attempting to squeeze with arms only",
    "Effectiveness": "High—especially strong in gi and MMA due to ability to pin the arm and isolate the neck while retaining dominant control.",
    "Related Techniques": "Arm Triangle from Mount || Mount to Side Arm Triangle Transition || Side Control Arm Triangle || D’Arce Choke (as alternate finish)",
    "Tags": "s-mount arm triangle | kata gatame s-mount | head-and-arm choke s-mount | BJJ | Judo | MMA | top control submission",
    "Notes": "Often used when the opponent defends standard mount arm triangle by framing or bridging—S-Mount changes the angle, making defense harder.",
