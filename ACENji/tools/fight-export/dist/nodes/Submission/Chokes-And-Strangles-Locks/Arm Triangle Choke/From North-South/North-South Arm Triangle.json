    "English Name": "Kata Gatame (From North-South)",
    "Japanese Name": "肩固め（ノースサウスから）",
    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (From North-South)",
    "Translation": "Shoulder Hold / Head-and-Arm Choke (From North-South)",
    "Aliases": "North-South Arm Triangle | North-South Kata Gatame | NS Head-and-Arm Choke",
    "Description": "A head-and-arm choke applied from the north-south position. The attacker traps one of the opponent’s arms across their neck, drops the near-side shoulder beside the head, and sprawls chest and hips to seal the carotids. The angle removes bridging power and makes late escapes difficult. Often entered when the defender turns in or as a finish after sliding off from mount or side control.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Shoulder/chest compression against opponent’s neck with their own arm as the wedge || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries); secondary pressure on shoulder || Forces | Downward chest pressure, shoulder drive, lateral squeeze, slight head turn to close space",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From side control, thread opponent’s far arm across their face and walk around the head to north-south while keeping head low. Block the hip with your hand or knee, drop shoulder by the trapped arm, gable/palm-to-bicep grip, sprawl hips, and “look away” while squeezing. Alternatively, attack from failed guillotine or when the turtle collapses to a hip.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Direct vascular choke; rapid finish when angle and shoulder depth are correct.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "North-south finish with walk-around head turn || Switch to side-control finish after locking || Hip-sprawl “lat shelf” finish for broad-shouldered opponents",
    "Training Notes": "Get your head deep first, then sprawl—don’t loosen the lock during the walk-around. Pin the opponent’s far hip to stop rolls. Think chest weight + shoulder wedge; hands only guide the squeeze. Micro-adjust by turning your head away and walking your hips a few inches.",
    "History / Origin": "Classic Judo kata gatame principle adapted to modern BJJ transitions, commonly chained after mount or side-control setups to maximize angle and remove bridging counters.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Arriving too high over the head || Letting the defender’s elbow slip back across the chest || Squeezing with arms only instead of using shoulder and chest pressure || Failing to block the near/far hip, allowing a spin-out",
    "Effectiveness": "High—north-south angle neutralizes common escapes and increases compression with minimal effort once shoulder depth is set.",
    "Related Techniques": "Arm Triangle from Side Control || Mount to Side Arm Triangle Transition || D’Arce Choke (if arm slips) || Mounted Triangle (different family)",
    "Tags": "north-south kata gatame | arm triangle north-south | head-and-arm choke NS | BJJ | Judo | MMA",
    "Notes": "If space remains, “walk the legs” around the head a few inches or switch to side-control finish without releasing the lock.",
