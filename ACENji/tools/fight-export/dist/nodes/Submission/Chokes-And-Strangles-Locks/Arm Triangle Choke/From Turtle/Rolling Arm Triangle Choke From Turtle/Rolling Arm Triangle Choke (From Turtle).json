    "Entity Name": "Rolling Arm Triangle Choke (From Turtle)",
    "English Name": "Rolling Head-and-Arm Choke (From Turtle)",
    "Japanese Name": "肩固め（亀からのローリング）",
    "English-Japanese Name": "Kata Gatame (Rolling from Turtle)",
    "Translation": "Rolling Shoulder Hold / Head-and-Arm Choke (From Turtle)",
    "Aliases": "Rolling Kata Gatame from Turtle | Turtle Roll Arm Triangle | Roll-Through Head-and-Arm",
    "Description": "A kata gatame variation against turtle where the choke is secured before rolling the defender over to complete the finish. The attacker threads to trap the arm across the neck, locks the head-and-arm, and then rolls the defender over a shoulder or hip, landing in side control or north–south to apply the choke with maximum shoulder pressure.",
    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Shoulder and chest compression of the carotids with defender’s arm as wedge || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries); shoulder (secondary) || Forces | Shoulder wedge, chest weight, roll-driven angle adjustment",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From top turtle, thread under the near arm and feed it across the neck. Lock gable or palm-to-bicep grip and drop head low beside the arm. Block far hip, then roll the defender over your near shoulder or hip. Land in tight side control or north–south and finish by squeezing chest and shoulder together.",
    "Martial Arts Used In": "BJJ | Judo | Sambo | Submission Grappling | MMA",
    "Danger Rating": "Danger: 9/10 | Rolling angle removes common turtle defenses and quickly tightens the choke.",
    "Legality in Competition": "IBJJF: Legal | Judo: Legal | Sambo: Legal | MMA: Legal | Submission Grappling: Legal",
    "Variants": "Gooseneck classical flexion | Downward wrist curl with elbow post | Wrist flexion from wall pin or clinch control",
    "Training Notes": "Keep grips locked through the roll. Do not roll without blocking the hip—otherwise defender may spin free. Roll smoothly, not explosively, to keep pressure continuous.",
    "History / Origin": "Developed as an adaptation of kata gatame in Judo newaza; frequently used in Sambo and BJJ to counter turtle posture by forcing defender to roll and exposing finishing angle.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Not controlling far hip before rolling || Rolling too fast and losing head position || Allowing defender’s elbow to slip free during the roll",
    "Effectiveness": "High—rolling movement breaks turtle base and creates finishing angle with minimal effort.",
    "Related Techniques": "Arm Triangle from Side Control || North-South Arm Triangle || Standard Turtle Kata Gatame Collapse || D’Arce Choke (if arm slips free)",
    "Tags": "rolling arm triangle turtle | kata gatame roll from turtle | head-and-arm choke turtle roll | BJJ | Judo | Sambo | MMA",
    "Notes": "Excellent counter when the defender stays tight in turtle; the roll forces positional change into a dominant choke finish.",
