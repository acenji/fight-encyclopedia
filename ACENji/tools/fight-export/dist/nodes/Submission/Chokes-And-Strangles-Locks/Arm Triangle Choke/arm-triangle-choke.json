    "Biomechanical Mechanism": "Action | Lateral compression of neck and arm || Joints Affected | Neck (carotid arteries), shoulder, upper arm || Torque Direction | Side pressure compressing arteries; slight rotation of neck and shoulder stabilizes hold",
    "Position / Entry Examples": "From mount | Slide around opponent’s trapped arm, lock head || From guard | Control opponent’s arm, pivot to side || From side control | Underhook arm, drive shoulder into neck || From north-south | Wrap arm around head, apply shoulder pressure || From turtle | Wrap arm, roll into kata gatame",

    "History / Origin": "Traditional in Judo (Kata Gatame) and later adopted in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for guard and top control submissions.",
    "Common Mistakes": "Head placement too high or low || Insufficient shoulder pressure || Arm not fully trapped || Poor body alignment reduces choke effectiveness",
