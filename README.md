## Repository Structure

- **Level-1-Top-Categories/**: Contains folders for main categories like Striking, Submissions, Clinch, etc.  
- Each category folder contains subfolders and data files (Excel, CSV, text, Google Sheets, Mac Numbers etc.) representing techniques and their details.  
- **templates/**: Placeholder for data templates such as the technique Excel/CSV template files.  
- **LICENSE**: MIT License for content data files and hierarchy.  
- **LICENSE-ACENJI.txt**: Proprietary license for the Acenji platform, combined datasets, and APIs.

## Data Hierarchy Example

All fight techniques, rules, and related info are organized in **7 levels** of hierarchy.  
This helps users navigate from broad fighting styles to the most detailed variation of a move.

**Example Path:**  
```
Submissions
â””â”€â”€ Joint Locks
   â””â”€â”€ Wrist Locks
      â””â”€â”€ Flexion
         â””â”€â”€ Gooseneck
            â””â”€â”€ Gooseneck from Top Side Control
               â””â”€â”€ Multimedia Examples
```
### Metadata Hierarchical Subcategory Formatting and Parsing

To represent hierarchical categories inside a **single metadata cell**, use the following delimiters:

- A **single pipe `|`** always introduces a **new top-level category** (Level 1).  
- After a top-level category, **double pipes `||`** separate **sub-items** (Level 2) that belong to that top-level category.

---

#### How to parse the example cell value:

Action | action1 || action2 | Affected | affected1 || affected2


Breakdown:  
- Start reading left to right.  
- **`Action`** is a top-level category.  
- Everything after `Action` until the next single pipe `|` (i.e., `action1 || action2`) are sub-items under `Action`. The `||` separates those sub-items.  
- At the next single pipe, **`Affected`** begins a new top-level category.  
- The sub-items after `Affected` until the next single pipe or end (i.e., `affected1 || affected2`) belong to `Affected`.

---

#### Visual grouping:

[Action | action1 || action2] | [Affected | affected1 || affected2]


This means:

- Top-level category: **Action**  
  - Sub-items: `action1`, `action2`  
- Top-level category: **Affected**  
  - Sub-items: `affected1`, `affected2`

---

### Notes:

- The order and placement of the pipes are essential for correct parsing.  
- Do **not** place sub-items separated by `||` before the first top-level category.  
- Additional deeper levels (Level 3+) can be added later with a different delimiter if needed.

Please follow this format consistently when filling hierarchical metadata fields.

## Folder Completion Status

To help track which folders have completed and verified data files, we use a simple marker file system:

- When a folder's data is finalized and ready, create a file named `DONE.txt` inside that folder.  
- The `DONE.txt` file can be empty or contain notes such as completion date, version, or contributor info.  
- Scripts and contributors can check for the presence of `DONE.txt` to know the folder is complete and does not require immediate changes.  

**Example:**  
```
Submissions/
Joint Locks/
Wrist Locks/
DONE.txt
Flexion/
Extension/
```

- This helps avoid duplicated work and clarifies the project's progress at a glance.

Please create or update the `DONE.txt` file when you finish working on a folder's contents.
 

ðŸ“Œ **Contributor Tips:**  
- Use clear and descriptive folder and file names.  
- Each folder contains only relevant files (CSV, TXT, Excel, Google Sheets links, Mac Numbers, etc.).  
- Consider adding a `readme.txt` inside folders to describe contents and guidelines.
